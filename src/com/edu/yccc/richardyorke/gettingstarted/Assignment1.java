// The 4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
// I got these definitions from Building Java Programs Third Edition by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp

// 1. Abstraction means that focusing on essentials properties rather than innter details.
// 2. Encapsulation is hiding the implementation details of an object from the clients of the object.
// 3. Inheritance is a programming technique that allows a derived class to extend the functionality of a base class, inheriting all of its state and behavior.
// 4. Polymorphism is the ability for the same code to be used with several different types of objects and for the code to behave differently depending on the actual type of object used.
